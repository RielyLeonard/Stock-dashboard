Stock Dashboard


The Power BI dashboard is seamlessly linked to Alpha Vantage, 
offering a comprehensive company overview before delving into more intricate metrics. 
Leveraging M code, I formatted a JSON query within Power BI, facilitating integration with the Alpha Vantage API. 
Additionally, I implemented a parameter in Power BI's data transformation mode, enabling effortless switching of ticker symbols across all queries. 
This agile setup empowers users to swiftly navigate and analyze diverse datasets with ease.
